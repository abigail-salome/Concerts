## Concert Management System
The Concert Management System is a Python-based application that uses SQLAlchemy to manage and interact with a database of bands, venues, and concerts. The system allows for the creation, querying, and deletion of data related to bands, venues, and concerts. The project showcases how to use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations and object relationships.

#### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. SQLAlchemy
3. SQLite (comes with Python standard library)
4. alembic (for database migrations)

#### Installation
1. Install Dependencies
* Make sure you have Python and SQLAlchemy installed. You can install SQLAlchemy and alembic using pip:pip install sqlalchemy

2. Database Configuration
* The application uses SQLite for the database, which is specified in the db variable in the main.py file. The database file is named concerts.db.

3. Create Database and Tables
* The main.py file is configured to create the database and tables if they do not already exist. Ensure the following code is executed to set up the database schema:
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from models import Base

db = "sqlite:///concerts.db"
engine = create_engine(db)
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

4. Setting Up Alembic
Alembic is a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. To set up Alembic for managing database migrations, follow these steps:
* Initialize Alembic
Run the following command to create an Alembic environment:alembic init alembic
This will create an alembic directory and an alembic.ini configuration file.

* Configure Alembic
Edit the alembic.ini file to set the database URL:sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///concerts.db
Update the env.py file in the alembic directory to include the model's metadata
from models import Base
target_metadata = Base.metadata

* Create a Migration Script
Generate a new migration script with:alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"

* Apply Migrations
Apply the migrations to your database with:alembic upgrade head

#### Models
1. Band
Attributes:
* bandID (Integer, primary key)
* name (String)
* hometown (String)
Methods:
* concerts(): Returns a list of concerts the band has played.
* venues(): Returns a list of distinct venues where the band has performed.
* all_introductions(): Returns a list of introduction strings for all concerts.
* most_performances(session): Class method that returns the band with the most concerts.

2. Venue
Attributes:
* venueID (Integer, primary key)
* title (String)
* city (String)
Methods:
* concerts(): Returns a list of all concerts at the venue.
* bands(): Returns a list of bands that have performed at the venue.
* play_in_venue(venue, date): Creates a new concert for the band in the specified venue on the given date.
* concert_on(date): Returns the first concert on the given date at this venue.
most_frequent_band(): Returns the band with the most concerts at the venue.

3. Concert
Attributes:
* concertID (Integer, primary key)
* bandID (Integer, foreign key to Band)
* venueID (Integer, foreign key to Venue)
* date (String)
Methods:
* band(): Returns the band instance for this concert.
* venue(): Returns the venue instance for this concert.
* hometown_show(): Returns True if the concert is in the band's hometown, otherwise False.
* introduction(): Returns a string with the band's introduction for this concert.

#### Usage
Running the Main Script
* To run the main.py script, use the following command:python main.py
* This script will demonstrate how to delete a concert by its ID and can be extended to include more operations.

#### Testing
To test various functionalities, you can create a separate script or use an interactive Python session. The main.py script can be modified to include additional tests for the methods provided.

#### Troubleshooting
1. File Not Found Error: Ensure the paths and filenames are correct and that all required files (models.py, concerts.db, etc.) are in the appropriate directories.
2. Database Connection Issues: Verify that the SQLite database file path is correct and that SQLAlchemy is properly installed.
